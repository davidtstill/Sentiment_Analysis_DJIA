# Performing Sentiment Analysis to Predict the Direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average

## Team Members:
- David Still
- Charles Xia
- Ian Walter

# Topic of the Analysis:
Can we accurately predict the direction of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by analyzing the news sentiment? 

# Hypothesis
News sentiment drives the short-term performance of the stock market. By analyzing the top news headlines around the world, we should be able to acccurately predict whether the DJIA goes up or down. 

# How We Performed the Analysis

## Project Proposal
This project is to utilize news sentiment to predict stock movement. The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) will generate positive sentiment of news gathered from Reddit's Top 25 headlines. Machine learning models will be run to see if we can predict future good or bad days of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). We will be sourcing our data from the a Kaggle dataset and Yahoo Finance.
